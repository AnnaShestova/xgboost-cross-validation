# xgboost-cross-validation
Solving classification problem by XGBoost model implementation; K-folds Cross Validation application for relevant performance metrics accessing. 

### Model evaluation results:
Accuracy: 0.8645
Precision (“exactness)”: 0.953605016
Recall (“precision”): 0.885331781
F1 Score (“compromise” between precision and recall): 0.918201026

### K-folds Cross Validation evaluation results:
Mean accuracy: 0.8629994451163204
Mean standard deviation: 0.010677872171663988

Obviously, the evaluation proves implemented model reliability.
